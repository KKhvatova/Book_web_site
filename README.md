# Project 1
## Book Reviews Web site

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

- <b>index.html</b> & <b>index_2.html</b> <br>
Users will be able to register for your website and then log in using their username and password. 

- <b>search.html</b> & <b>success.html</b> & <b>book_page.html</b> <br>
Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. 

- <b>flask jsonify</b> <br>
You’ll also use the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via your website’s API.
